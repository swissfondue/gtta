                <h2>Metasploit</h2>

                <p>
                    There is only 1 script responsible for the whole metasploit integration. In order to create a metasploit check script, please do the following:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Create an automated check (or choose an existing one) that will hold the metasploit script.</li>
                    <li>Go to the <em>Scripts</em> section of that check.</li>
                    <li>Press <em>New Script</em> button.</li>
                    <li>Choose <b>metasploit</b> package in the package list and hit <em>Save</em>.</li>
                    <li>Now you need to create an input that will hold the metasploit commands. Please go to the <em>Inputs</em> section of the script you just created.</li>
                    <li>Hit <em>New Input</em> button.</li>
                    <li>
                        Setup the input that will hold the metasploit script:
                        <ol>
                            <li><em>Name</em> - the name doesn't actually matter - you can enter anything there (for instance, it can be named as <b>Script</b>).</li>
                            <li><em>Type</em> - set it to <b>Textarea</b></li>
                            <li>
                                <em>Value</em> - enter metasploit commands here - the same commands that you would use for msfconsole command in metasploit.
                                Please note, that the system automatically adds <b>run</b> and <b>exit</b> commands at the end of each script, so the script will be launched automatically.

                                <p>
                                    You can use some variables in your script:
                                </p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>@target</b> - check target</li>
                                    <li>
                                        <b>@argN</b> - a file with values from the other input. <b>N</b> here is a number starting from 0,
                                        so <b>@arg0</b> would be the first input, <b>@arg1</b> would be the second input and so on.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>Here is the example script that does a SSH bruteforce:</p>

                                <pre>use auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_login
set rhosts @target
set userpass_file @arg0
set threads 3</pre>
                            </li>
                            <li><em>Visible</em> - unset the checkbox, so the input won't be visible in the checklist.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <div class="help-images">

                    <li>
                        If you have used some additional arguments in your script (<b>@arg0</b>, <b>@arg1</b>, etc.), then you will need to add
                        corresponding inputs to the script. For our example script above you need to specify an additional input that will hold
                        login/password pairs. Please refer to metasploit documentation to find out the required file formats for each module.

                <p>
                    You can generate project report using a custom Word template. In order to make a proper Word template,
                    you should have a Microsoft Windows machine with Microsoft Word 2010 or more. Please note, that
                    older Microsoft Word versions or Microsoft Word for Mac OS are not suitable for creating custom templates.
                </p>

                <p>
                    First of all, you need to enable the <em>Developer</em> tab in Word - you will need it for inserting
                    variables and lists into the template. Please refer to <a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb608625.aspx">Microsoft Office documentation</a>
                    on how to do this. After that tab is enabled, switch to it and enable the <em>Design Mode</em>.
                    You need this mode to make all lists and variables visible.

                    <div class="help-images">
                        <a class="fancybox" title="Design Mode" href="<?php echo $this->createUrl("app/file", array("section" => "help", "subsection" => "custom-reports", "file" => "1.png")); ?>"><img src="<?php echo $this->createUrl("app/file", array("section" => "help", "subsection" => "custom-reports", "file" => "1-small.png")); ?>" alt="Design Mode"></a>

                        Simple global variables insert some static data into the report. All variables
                        look like a usual text within curly brackets (for example, <em>{variable_name}</em>).
                        The following variables are supported:

                    <p>
                        Content control blocks are responsible for inserting lists and variables
                        into the report. You can insert content control blocks by pressing the <em>Rich Text Content Control</em>
                        button in the <em>Developer</em> tab.

                        <div class="help-images">

                    <p>
                        After the content control is inserted into the template, you should press the <em>Properties</em>
                        button to edit its properties. The title of the content control doesn't affect anything - you can
                        put there anything you want, so you can easily know what that control does. The system uses the
                        field named <em>Tag</em>.

                        <div class="help-images">

                            <em>variable</em> - you can use variables to insert content into the report, in conditions
                            and list filters. A variable tag looks like this:

                            <pre>var:SCOPE.NAME</pre>

                                        <em>SCOPE</em> - an optional variable visibility scope. <em>Scope</em> is an object,
                                        from which the variable will get its value. The reporting engine uses <em>scopes</em>
                                        to access variables in lists. You can skip the scope specification for
                                        a variable, then the system will take the corresponding value from the current scope.

                                    <em>NAME</em> - variable name. Available variable names depend on object you get that
                                    variable from. See the <a href="#variable-list">full list of all available objects and their variables</a>

                            <pre>var:project.name</pre>

                        <li>
                            <em>list</em> - a list of objects. For example, it could be a list of targets within a project
                            or a list of checks within a control. A list looks as follows:

                            <pre>list:SCOPE.NAME</pre>

                             <ul>
                                <li>

                                        <em>SCOPE</em> - an optional list visibility scope. <em>Scope</em> is an object,
                                        from which the variable will get its list. The reporting engine uses <em>scopes</em>
                                        to access variables in lists. You can skip the scope specification for
                                        a list, then the system will take the corresponding value from the current scope.
                                        See the <a href="#scopes-explanation">detailed scopes explanation</a> for more info.
                                    </p>

                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <em>NAME</em> - list name. Available list names depend on object you get that
                                    list from. See the <a href="#variable-list">full list of all available list names</a>
                                    for more info.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            You can nest multiple list types into each other, so, for example if you use
                            <em>list:category</em> on the top level, it will contain all categories across all targets within
                            that project. Then you can create a list called <em>list:check</em> within it and that list will
                            contain all checks within that particular category for all targets. The same is for other
                            lists - if you create a target list, which has category list and which has check list, then
                            you will get a checklist for each category within each target. Please refer to a <a href="#variable-list">list of
                            possible object lists</a> below.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <em>filter</em> - you can filter lists by using filter on certain list item variable. A list
                            with a filter looks like this:

                            <pre>list:LIST|filter:VARIABLE(VALUE)</pre>

                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <em>LIST</em> - the name of a list variable. For example, it could be <em>project.target</em>,
                                    which would refer to the project target list. See the <a href="#variable-list">full list of all available objects and their variables</a>
                                    for more info.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <em>VARIABLE</em> - the name of some variable within the list item. So, if you have a list of checks,
                                    then it should be a check variable, etc. Please note that it's not allowed to use a
                                    scope specifier here, only variable names are allowed. For example, if you have a list of checks,
                                    it could be <em>rating</em>, which would refer to the check rating. You can check a full
                                    list of variables for corresponding objects above, in the "variable" section.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <em>VALUE</em> - the scalar value (number or text), against which the variable is checked.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <br>

                            <p>
                                For example, if you want to have a list of only high-risk checks, then the following tag
                                should be used:
                                <pre>list:check|filter:rating(high)</pre>
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                You can use filters for every list and on every variable, but currently that mostly makes sense
                                only for check lists and check ratings.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <em>condition</em> - condition block. If the condition is true, then the text inside this content control
                            is inserted into the report, otherwise the content block is removed. The condition tag looks like this:

                            <pre>if:VARIABLE(VALUE)</pre>

                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <em>VARIABLE</em> - the name of some variable. For example, it could be <em>project.rating</em>,
                                    which would refer to the project overall rating. You can check a full list of available variables above,
                                    in the "variable" section.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <em>VALUE</em> - is the value, against which the variable is checked. There are 3 value
                                    types supported:

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            scalar value (some number or text) - checks if the variable specified
                                            is equal to the value provided. For example, you need to check if project rating
                                            is equal to 5:
                                            <pre>if:project.rating(5)</pre>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            list of numbers or text values - checks if the variable specified is equal
                                            to one of the values provided. For example, you need to check if id is equal
                                            to 1, 2 or 3:
                                            <pre>if:id(1,2,3)</pre>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            range of numbers - checks if the variable specified is within the given
                                            range (the range includes both starting and ending values). For example,
                                            you check if rating is >= 2 and <= 5 as follows:
                                            <pre>if:rating(2..5)</pre>
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                        <h3>Scopes Explanation</h3>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Scopes mechanism comes into action when you use object lists. For example, when you use some variables within
                        a <em>category</em> list, your current scope will be tied to a <em>category</em> from that list. So, if you use a variable
                        named <em>name</em> without any explicit scope specification inside that block, the system will know that it needs
                        to insert there the name of a particular <em>category</em> from that list.
                        </p>

                    <p>
                        Then, for example, within that <em>category</em> block you need to have a list of <em>controls</em>. And
                        inside the control block you use a variable named <em>name</em> without scope specification.
                        In this case the system will get the value from the particular <em>control</em>, because
                        <em>control</em> is the current variable scope.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If you have multiple nested lists, you can access to variables of the upper level lists by specifying
                        the scope modififer. For example, you have 3 nested lists: <em>targets</em> &rarr; <em>categories</em> &rarr; <em>checks</em>.
                        You can access target's variables from the check or category block by specifying the scope, for example:
                        <em>var:target.host</em> (<em>target</em> here is the desired variable scope).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The default scope for the report is a <em>project</em> object. In other words,
                        when you use a variable without a scope specified and which is not inside any lists, it will
                        get its value from the <em>project</em> object.
                    </p>

                        GTTA uses the unique packaging system to manage scripts that are used in checks.
                        The system supports 2 types of packages - script and library packages.
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <em>Library Package</em> - can be used by <em>Script Packages</em> or other <em>Library Packages</em>.
                            Usually it provides some common functions that can be useful for several scripts or libraries (for example, website crawler).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <em>Script Package</em> - the script that performs test or attack actions. User can launch the script by linking it to a particular automated
                            check and pressing the <em>Start</em> button on this check in some project that uses that check.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        GTTA provides a lot of useful libraries and scripts out of the box. The built-in scripts apparently can't cover all possible
                        needs, so you are able to upload your custom libraries and scripts as well. This guide describes all required steps to do that.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Currently GTTA supports scripts in Python and Perl programming languages. If you wish to use any other language or even a compiled
                        binary program (yeah, that's possible), you should use either a Python or Perl wrapper for it. All scripts you upload must comply with
                        GTTA API requirements (see the API section below for more information).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        All scripts run in the jailed environment (the Sandbox) which is separate from the main system, so you may use scripts without being
                        afraid to delete something important. In the worst case your Sandbox can become corrupted (for example, you may accidentally delete
                        some system file). If this happens, you can just regenerate the Sandbox from the <em>System &rarr; Scripts</em> menu - it will delete the old
                        Sandbox and create a new one with all scripts and dependencies installed.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Package Structure</h3>

                    <p>
                        GTTA package (both library and script) is a folder with some files in it. All packages at least contain 1 file named <em>package.yaml</em>,
                        which contains package descrpition. The package description file is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML">YAML</a> file.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Example <em>package.yaml</em> (all section meanings are described below):
                    </p>

                    <pre>type: library
name: example
version: 1.7
system: false
dependencies:
  library:
    - testlibrary
    - customlibrary
  script:
    - somescript
    - test
  system:
    - tcpdump
    - nikto
  deb:
    - nmap_6.66-1_i386.deb
  python:
    - nltk
    - pybloomfiltermmap
  perl:
    - Net::SSL
    - LWP::UserAgent</pre>

                    <p>
                        The package description file has several sections. All sections are mandatory, unless otherwise specified.
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <em>type</em> - package type, either <b>library</b> or <b>script</b>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <em>name</em> - package name, allowed characters - a-z, digits, underline, comma and colon. The name must be in lower case letters. The name
                            must be unique, i.e. there should be no packages with the same name in the system, otherwise the installation will fail.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <em>version</em> - package version, any format.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <em>system</em> - system package flag, either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>. All custom packages must have this option set to <b>false</b>, since <b>true</b> is
                            allowed only for built-in packages.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <em>dependencies</em> - a list of dependencies for this package. This section is optional - some packages can be fully independent.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        As shown above, there can be 6 types of dependencies. All sections described below are optional:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <em>library</em> - here you can specify a list of GTTA libraries required for this package. The libraries specified in this section must be
                            already installed when you package is being installed, otherwise the installation process will fail.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <em>script</em> - this section contains a list of GTTA script dependencies. The scripts must be already installed prior to this package
                            installation.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <em>system</em> - system dependencies. GTTA uses Debian 6 operating system underneath and this section contains a list of system package
                            dependencies that can be installed from the Debian APT repository.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <em>deb</em> - Debian binary package dependencies. Not all required packages can be found in the standard Debian repository, so you can use
                            your custom-built (or downloaded from the internet) Debian binary packages to install the required software. In order to install a
                            custom Debian binary package you should put it to the GTTA package folder (the same folder that contains your <em>package.yaml</em>) and
                            include it to this section of <em>package.yaml</em>. Please note, that the Debian binary package name must conform to the standard Debian
                            naming convention: &lt;name&gt;_&lt;VersionNumber&gt;-&lt;RevisionNumber&gt;_i386.deb. Please refer to this documentation for more info -

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <em>python</em> - Python library dependencies that will be installed using <a href="http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/">pip package manager</a>. Debian
                            APT repository doesn't contain all available Python libraries and a lot of Python libraries in APT are outdated, so you might want
                            to install recent Python libraries using pip. If you want to install the specific version of a Python package and not the latest one,
                            then please specify the name in the following format - <b>name==version</b> (for example, <b>pybloomfiltermmap==0.2.0</b>).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <em>perl</em> - Perl library dependencies that will be installed using <a href="http://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a>. Unlike Debian APT repository, CPAN contains
                            all available and most recent Perl libraries, so you might want to use it to install Perl libraries.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Please note, that <b>library</b> and <b>script</b> dependecies must be installed manually (using GTTA GUI) prior to your package installation,
                        otherwise the installation will fail. Other dependency sections contain information about software that will be installed automatically
                        during your package installation.

                    <p>
                        <em>Library Package</em> is a package that provides some services (functions, data, etc.) for other GTTA libraries or scripts. There are no
                        additional requirements for <em>Library Packages</em> - they can contain literally anything - custom Python modules, custom Perl modules,
                        shell scripts, anything. GTTA API for scripts contains methods that will help you to get an absolute filesystem path for a
                        certain library using only its name, so you will be able to use all files in a library from your scripts by including them (if we are
                        talking about Python or Perl modules), by running them or by opening and reading them as regular files.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For example, if you have a Python library and you are planning to use it from multiple scripts, it's a good idea to upload that
                        library as a GTTA <em>Library Package</em>, so your <em>Script Packages</em> won't have to provide their own copies of the same library. The same thing
                        is with Perl libraries or custom-built Debian binary packages.

                    <h3>Script Package</h3>

                    <p>
                        <em>Script Package</em> is a package that contains a script that can be launched by GTTA to do some test or attack. GTTA has very strict
                        requirements for scripts in order to be able to run them and make the developer's life much easier. There are 3 basic requirements
                        for all <em>Script Packages</em>:
                    </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            The script must be coded in Python 2.7 (preferred) or Perl 5.14 scripting language. You may create a script in any other language, but in this
                            case you must create a Python or Perl wrapper for it.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The script must have a predefined entry point script named <em>run.py</em> or <em>run.pl</em> (for Python and Perl scripts, respectively).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The script must use GTTA API for the corresponding programming language.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>
                        The <em>Script Package</em> may contain any number of additional files. You can do with them anything you need - include them from your script
                        as additional modules, you can read and write them or run them as an external program.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As have been said before, all scripts run in the Sandbox and are not connected to the main system. All changes done by scripts may be
                        lost on Sandbox Regeneration, so don't store any sensitive information from your scripts to any files besides the result file. The
                        result file is transferred to the main system after the script finishes its work, so it's the only safe place to store the information.

                        <h4>Low Level API</h4>

                        <p>
                            This section describes how scripts work on the lowest level and this information should be used only to understand how the process goes
                            underneath. When you will create your script, you must use GTTA API, since the Low Level API may change in future and your scripts will
                            stop working in the next GTTA versions, but GTTA API will remain the same as long as possible.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Scripts are launched in the background mode with certain command line arguments. Every command line argument passed to GTTA script
                            is a path to a file, which contains some input data. An input file is a sequence of lines separated by the Line Feed symbols
                            (LF, 0x0A or \n) and every single line is assumed to be a separate input record.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            First two command line arguments (i.e. input files) are mandatory and are passed to every GTTA script:
                        </p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Path to a target file, which describes a target system that should be checked and some basic check settings.</li>
                            <li>Path to an output file that should be used to write the script output.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>
                            Other command line arguments are completely optional and depend on the particular check requirements.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Here is a list of lines, that describe the target:
                        </p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <em>IP Address (Host Name)</em> – target's network addres – either IP, or FQDN.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <em>Protocol</em> – a name of the protocol, that should be used during this check. For example, if a script performs a web test,
                                this field may have one of these values: http or https. Of course, the script can just silently ignore this option.
                            </li
                            <li>
                                <em>Port Number</em> – a target's port number to connect. This option could be ignored.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <em>Language</em> – user selected language code – English or German (en, de). Currently all scripts ignore this option, but if your script
                                needs to output different information depending on the selected language – this option might be useful.

                            Result file is a sequence of lines, separated by Line Feed symbols. Result file can contain several control sequences, that will be
                            processed by the GUI to be able to display the information for the user in more convenient way. The control sequence is a simple XML
                            text with special tags.

                            This control sequence allows displaying tables tied to the check. The control sequence looks like this:
                        </p>

                        <pre>&lt;gtta-table&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;99&lt;/cell&gt;
    &lt;/row&gt;
&lt;/gtta-table></pre>

                        <p>This example contains several required control tags:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><em>columns</em> – contains table column definitions</li>

                                <em>column</em> – defines a name for a single column. Attribute named <em>width</em> contains a width definition for the column.
                                Width is a float number ≤ 1.0 (1.0 is a full table width).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <em>row</em> - contains a list of cells for a row.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <em>cell</em> – defines a cell content.
                            </li>

                            This control sequence allows adding attachments to the check object. The control sequence looks like this:

                        <pre>&lt;gtta-image src="/path/to/file.png"&gt;&lt;/gtta-image&gt;</pre>

                        <p>
                            Attribute <em>src</em> contains a local path to the file to be attached, so the check script is totally responsible for downloading that
                            file to the local host. After attachment is added to a project, the system automatically deletes the source file.

                            The system allows to attach any kind of files, the main tag is called <em>gtta-image</em> because mostly this mechanism will be used for

                            Python API is a standard GTTA library which helps to create automated scripts in Python.
                            The library implements some common tasks, such as parsing command line arguments, reading
                            input files and writing to the output file. All Python checks should use this library.
                            The Python API library is the preferred way to do automated check scripts.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In order to use the library, a script should import <em>core</em> library into its namespace.
                            The script should declare some class inherited from the base class <em>Task</em>. The ancestor
                            class should implement a function named <em>main</em> – this function should do the script’s job.
                            Function <em>main</em> will be called just after library parsed all command line arguments.
                            The list of function’s parameters depends on additional arguments that have been passed to the script.
                            Here's the example:

                            <pre># coding: utf-8

from core import Task, execute_task

class Example(Task):
    """Example task"""

    def main(self, *args):
        """Main function"""
        self._write_result("Hello there!")

    def test(self):
        """Test function"""
        self.main()

execute_task(Example)</pre>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            For example, if the script has been called like this:

                            <pre>run.py target.txt result.txt data1.txt data2.txt</pre>

                            then main function will be called with 2 parameters (except self class reference) – the first
                            parameter will contain a list of lines in data1.txt file, the second will contain a list of
                            lines in data2.txt file. If input files are empty, then empty lists will be passed.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            For example, if the first file contains 2 lines and the second one is empty, a function call
                            may look like this:

                            <pre>main(["first line", "second line"], [])</pre>

                        </p>

                                <li>
                                    <em>self.host</em> – domain name (if it was specified on the first line of the target file).

                                    but not both can be specified at the same time, since there is only 1 field in the

                        <p>
                            <em>Task</em> class has some constants, which are responsible for how input files are processed
                            and how much time this particular task can take. You can override these constants in your script
                            class:

                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <em>TIMEOUT</em> - the maximum amount of time in seconds this script can work. After that
                                    time passes, the script gets killed. The default value is 60 seconds.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <em>TEST_TIMEOUT</em> - the maximum amount of time in seconds this script can work in
                                    test mode. After that time passes, the script gets killed. The default value is 30 seconds.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <em>PARSE_FILES</em> - boolean value, which determines if core library should split
                                    input files by lines. If this constant is <b>True</b> (default), then API reads all
                                    input files into memory and splits them by line. If this constant is <b>False</b>, then
                                    API just passes the file name as input argument. This constant can be useful if you have
                                    big input files that can consume a lot of resources if you read them in memory.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <b>Modules, Classes, Methods and Functions</b>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            There are several useful functions and methods provided by API that you can use in your scripts:

                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <em>core</em> - core module that contains everything needed to create a script.

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            <em>execute_task(class_name)</em> - function that is used to show
                                            which class contains the main script code. After class declaration, the script should
                                            call this function with the name of your script class as an argument.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <em>Task</em> - base class for all scripts.

                                            <ul>
                                                <li>
                                                    <em>Task.main(*args)</em> - main script function. This function implementation is required for
                                                    every script.
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    <em>Task.test()</em> - you can use this function to test the script without creating
                                                    all the required files. Just run the script like this:
                                                    <pre>run.py --test</pre>
                                                    and the API will call <em>Task.test</em> function instead of <em>Task.main</em>.
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    <em>Task._write_result(data)</em> - writes <em>data</em> into a result file. One method
                                                    call will produce a single line in the output file.
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    <em>Task._check_stop()</em> - call this method before and after doing time-consuming or
                                                    blocking operations – it checks if the script should stop execution and exit.
                                                    Scripts can be terminated by user request from GUI, so it’s required to perform this kind of check.
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    <em>Task._get_library_path(library)</em> - get local filesystem path to a <em>Library Package</em>
                                                    named <em>library</em>. This method is useful when you need to call or use some files from
                                                    the <em>Library Package</em>.
                                                </li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <em>ResultTable</em> - result table class, which helps to create Result Tables very easily.

                                            <ul>
                                                <li>
                                                    <em>__init__(columns)</em> - create table with <em>columns</em> as a list of column definitions.
                                                    This list should contain of dictionaries with the following keys:

                                                    <ul>
                                                        <li><em>name</em> - column name</li>
                                                        <li><em>width</em> - column width (0 .. 1, 1 = 100%)</li>
                                                    </ul>

                                                    <p>
                                                        Example:

                                                    <em>add_row(row)</em> - add row with data to a table. <em>row</em> is a list of respective column values.

                                                    <p>
                                                        Example:

                                                    <em>render()</em> - get a rendered XML table. You can get a result of this function and directly write it
                                                    to a result file using <em>Task._write_result</em>.
                                                </li>
                                            </ul>

                                                Typical <em>ResultTable</em> usage example:

                                                <pre># create table columns
table = ResultTable([
    {"name": "Number", "width": 0.3},

])

# add rows
table.add_row(["1", "john@doe.com", "123"])
table.add_row(["2", "hello@world.com", "666"])
table.add_row(["3", "bob@bob.com", "444"])

# output table to results
self._write_result(table.render())</pre>
                                            </p>

                            Perl API is a standard GTTA library which helps to create automated scripts in Perl.
                            The library implements some common tasks, such as parsing command line arguments, reading
                            input files and writing to the output file. All Perl checks should use this library.

                            In order to use the library, a script should import
                            <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~ether/MooseX-Declare-0.38/lib/MooseX/Declare.pm">MooseX::Declare</a>
                            (Perl API uses it for object-oriented interface) and <em>core::task</em> modules. The script should
                            declare some class inherited from the base class <em>Task</em>. The ancestor
                            class should implement a method named <em>main</em> – this function should do the script’s job.
                            Function <em>main</em> will be called just after library parsed all command line arguments.
                            The list of function’s parameters depends on additional arguments that have been passed to the script.
                            Here's the example:

                            <pre>use MooseX::Declare;
use core::task qw(execute);

# Example Perl script
class Example extends Task {
    # Main function
    method main($args) {
        $self->_write_result("Hello there!");
    }

    # Test function
    method test {
        $self->main();
    }
}

execute(Example->new());</pre>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            For example, if the script has been called like this:

                            <pre>run.pl target.txt result.txt data1.txt data2.txt</pre>

                            then main function will be called with 2 parameters (except self class reference) – the first
                            parameter will contain a list of lines in data1.txt file, the second will contain a list of
                            lines in data2.txt file. If input files are empty, then empty lists will be passed.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            For example, if the first file contains 2 lines and the second one is empty, a function call
                            may look like this:

                            <pre>main(["first line", "second line"], []);</pre>

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <b>Attributes</b>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <em>Task</em> class has some attributes, which give access to data in the target file:

                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <em>$self->target</em> – target name (either host name or IP address).
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <em>$self->host</em> – domain name (if it was specified on the first line of the target file).
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <em>$self->ip</em> – IP-address (if target file contained one). Only host name or IP address,
                                    but not both can be specified at the same time, since there is only 1 field in the
                                    target file that contains host address data.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <em>$self->proto</em> – protocol name.

                                    <em>$self->port</em> – port number.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <em>$self->lang</em> – language code.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <b>Constants</b>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <em>Task</em> class has some constants, which are responsible for how input files are processed
                            and how much time this particular task can take. You can override these constants in your script
                            class:

                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <em>TIMEOUT</em> - the maximum amount of time in seconds this script can work. After that
                                    time passes, the script gets killed. The default value is 60 seconds.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <em>TEST_TIMEOUT</em> - the maximum amount of time in seconds this script can work in
                                    test mode. After that time passes, the script gets killed. The default value is 30 seconds.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <em>PARSE_FILES</em> - boolean value, which determines if core library should split
                                    input files by lines. If this constant is <b>1</b> (default), then API reads all
                                    input files into memory and splits them by line. If this constant is <b>0</b>, then
                                    API just passes the file name as input argument. This constant can be useful if you have
                                    big input files that can consume a lot of resources if you read them in memory.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                        <p>
                            <b>Modules, Classes, Methods and Functions</b>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            There are several useful functions and methods provided by API that you can use in your scripts:

                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <em>core::task</em> - core module that contains everything needed to create a script.

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            <em>execute(task_object)</em> - function that is used to show
                                            which object contains the main script code. After class declaration, the script should
                                            call this function with the instantiated object of your script class as an argument.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <em>Task</em> - base class for all scripts.

                                            <ul>
                                                <li>
                                                    <em>Task->main($args)</em> - main script function. This function implementation is required for
                                                    every script.
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    <em>Task->test()</em> - you can use this function to test the script without creating
                                                    all the required files. Just run the script like this:
                                                    <pre>run.pl --test</pre>
                                                    and the API will call <em>Task->test</em> function instead of <em>Task->main</em>.
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    <em>Task->_write_result($data)</em> - writes <em>$data</em> into a result file. One method
                                                    call will produce a single line in the output file.
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    <em>Task->_check_stop()</em> - call this method before and after doing time-consuming or
                                                    blocking operations – it checks if the script should stop execution and exit.
                                                    Scripts can be terminated by user request from GUI, so it’s required to perform this kind of check.
                                                </li>
                                                <li>

                                                    named <em>$library</em>. This method is useful when you need to call or use some files from
                                                    the <em>Library Package</em>.

                    <h3>Building Your Package</h3>

                    <p>
                        Please follow these steps to build your package.

                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Create an empty folder which will contain package files (for example, <em>package</em>).

                                <div class="help-images">
                                    <a class="fancybox" title="Package Folder" href="<?php echo $this->createUrl("app/file", array("section" => "help", "subsection" => "integration", "file" => "1.png")); ?>"><img src="<?php echo $this->createUrl("app/file", array("section" => "help", "subsection" => "integration", "file" => "1-small.png")); ?>" alt="Package Folder"></a>
                                </div>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Create a package description file named <em>package.yaml</em> and fill it with required contents.

                                <div class="help-images">
                                    <a class="fancybox" title="Package Description File" href="<?php echo $this->createUrl("app/file", array("section" => "help", "subsection" => "integration", "file" => "2.png")); ?>"><img src="<?php echo $this->createUrl("app/file", array("section" => "help", "subsection" => "integration", "file" => "2-small.png")); ?>" alt="Package Description File"></a>

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Put all required files into this folder (if you are doing the <em>Script Package</em>,
                                then don't forget to put an entry point file - <em>run.py</em> or <em>run.pl</em>).

                                    <a class="fancybox" title="Package Files" href="<?php echo $this->createUrl("app/file", array("section" => "help", "subsection" => "integration", "file" => "3.png")); ?>"><img src="<?php echo $this->createUrl("app/file", array("section" => "help", "subsection" => "integration", "file" => "3-small.png")); ?>" alt="Package Files"></a>

                            <li>
                                ZIP your folder, so you will have a file named <em>package.zip</em> as a result.

                                Go to <em>System &rarr; Scripts</em>, then choose the corresponding category
                                (<em>Libraries</em> or <em>Scripts</em>).

                                Go to the last page of package list and check the status of your package. It will take a while
                                until your package is installed.

                                <div class="help-images">
